## 2026-09-21 — codebase — Repository inspection: no application code exists

**Question**

The mission and spec (§22) require tracing the existing creation journey (landing → personalisation → generation → preview → checkout → order). What application code actually exists?

**Sources / code inspected**

- `ls -la` and full `glob **/*` of `/Users/harshvardhansolanki/Developer/for-little-one`
- `find` across `/Users/harshvardhansolanki` for `*for*little*one*`, `*littleone*`, `*for-little*`
- `git -C` status on the workspace (no `.git`)
- `grep -ril --include=package.json -E "openpolotno|medusa"` across the home directory (no matches)
- Developer/ sibling repos checked for relevance (cloak-cluely-ai-assistant, invisible-ai-assistant, rag-sdk-template, career-ops — all unrelated projects)

**Observed**

- The workspace contains ONLY: `AGENTS.md`, `project-spec-initial.md`, and the `.planning/` directory. No `package.json`, no source files, no config, no Dockerfile, no `.git`.
- No codebase for For Little One exists anywhere under the home directory. The two other "For little one" hits (`Documents/ChatGPT/For little one`, `Downloads/…Research Before Build.md`) contain no commits and a draft of the same spec respectively.
- Therefore: no existing commerce, no existing generation pipeline, no existing book model, no existing editor, no existing print integration, no existing DB/auth/storage/queue.

**Conclusion**

`for-little-one` is currently a **research-only, greenfield planning workspace**, not an existing product codebase. The mission instruction "preserve good existing work" has nothing to apply to yet. All systems described in the mission are **ADD/BUILD**, not KEEP/MODIFY/REPLACE. The strategic value of the existing work is the research itself (`project-spec-initial.md` + `.planning/`), which should be preserved and extended.

**Impact**

- Feature specs' "Current implementation" sections must state `None (Observed)` and cite this log rather than fabricating existing systems.
- `PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE_V2.md` must be honest that the "existing architecture" is documentation-only; the architecture proposal is greenfield but must still respect the decision framework (D001–D013) and the "no rewrite for its own sake" discipline (there is simply nothing to rewrite yet).
- Medusa / OpenPolotno evaluations should be forward-looking adoption decisions, not migration decisions.
- Recommended: when the first code is introduced, initialise a git repo in this workspace.

**Follow-up**

- None blocking. If a codebase is later located elsewhere, re-run this inspection and reconcile.
